How to test scripts in target

172.30.0.47 and 172.30.0.162 are hardware boxes which are connected via 10G cable.

for testing in target envinrornment we need two boards (.47 com2 and .162com2).

after login into .47 pc root@host# conman -j com2
it enters into root@host:/home/application#

we need our image into above path i.e /home/application/ISS.exe

for copying the image(now we are in .47 pc and need to copy image to this pc and mentioned path) and consider our image in .194pc /home/Satish/iss_core/code/future/LR/ISS.exe   then
root@host:/home/application#scp root@172.30.0.194:/home/Satish/iss_core/code/future/LR/ISS.exe test1.exe----     we are copying image and renamed to test1.exe in our /home/application path
now in our .47pc

#gdb ./test1.exe

it will goto ISS login page
iss#r s erps1 --   erps1 file is script and that file also need to copy in the /home/application path in .47pc
